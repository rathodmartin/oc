  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The First Niagara OpenUP suite of processes,&amp;nbsp;maturity models, process elements and guidance content is&#xD;
    organized&amp;nbsp;in a specific way. The&amp;nbsp;methods, activities and tasks, work products and people&amp;nbsp;needed to&#xD;
    describe these items&amp;nbsp;make up a process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In short,&amp;nbsp;Process&amp;nbsp;Engineering Process is the process of describing, documenting, &amp;nbsp;designing, building,&#xD;
    testing and deplying a First Niagara process or process element. &lt;img style=&quot;WIDTH: 1042px; HEIGHT: 627px&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Imagine the factory floor. Raw materials enter the floor from one end of the large building, twisting and turning&#xD;
    through various stations, transformed to pieces or parts of the end product that is later sold to consumers. Now,&#xD;
    imagine the same factory where each station is &lt;strong>&lt;u>not&lt;/u>&lt;/strong> integrated with other stations. In fact,&#xD;
    when material leaves one station, workers have little knowledge where to send the material for the next station or in&#xD;
    what form the next station requires for optimal processing. Imagine the chaos and quality of products leaving the&#xD;
    factory floor and the amount of time and money wasted on each unit produced.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To avoid such a scenario, factories rely heavily on an end-to-end process that integrates stations and one that is&#xD;
    organized to streamline the manufacturing of raw materials to the end product. In fact, factories are always looking&#xD;
    for ways to speed the production process and get the finished product to the consumer in the quickest way and with high&#xD;
    quality. First Niagara projects are deliverable to the First Niagara business. As such, the raw material (business&#xD;
    needs and requirements) must be shaped, stretched, and formed to become the application or system business uses to&#xD;
    deliver products and services to generate First Niagara revenue.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Without a structured approach, domain (or content) owners will develop processes using tools and techniques that are&#xD;
    inconsistent between domains (stations). Description and documentation styles vary as evidenced in swimlane diagrams,&#xD;
    use cases, or Microsoft Visio flowcharts and Microsoft Word documents. Further, without a structured approach, design&#xD;
    and development of processes may follow&amp;nbsp;a path best suited to the&amp;nbsp;description and documentation rather than a&#xD;
    process engineering discipline.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Process Engineering Process is a structured approach that gives domain owners the ability to focus on development&#xD;
    of comprehensive processes and process elements and associated descriptions.&amp;nbsp;The Process Engineering Process also&#xD;
    gives the methods and tools&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;present material in a consistent way&amp;nbsp;so consumers of&amp;nbsp;methodology can&#xD;
    find and use relevant information&amp;nbsp;consistently between projects.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
