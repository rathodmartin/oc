    Domain processes are seldom sequential. For parallel processes, define the sequence of events and locate any race&#xD;
    conditions. Race conditions are when two steps are running simultaneously and come together to result in&amp;nbsp;a third&#xD;
    step. The third step can only begin once the required information from the previous two steps have completed. If the&#xD;
    sequence step completion is important for the third step, what governors are in place to ensure the second step does&#xD;
    not complete early?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
