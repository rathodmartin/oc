            The OpenUP suite of processes,&amp;nbsp;maturity models, process elements and guidance content is organized&amp;nbsp;in a
            specific way. The&amp;nbsp;methods, activities and tasks, work products and people&amp;nbsp;needed to describe these
            items&amp;nbsp;make up a process.
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>
            In short,&amp;nbsp;Process&amp;nbsp;Engineering Process is the process of describing, documenting, &amp;nbsp;designing, building,
            testing and deplying a First Niagara process or process element.&amp;nbsp;
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>
            Imagine the factory floor. Raw materials enter the floor from one end of the large building, twisting and turning
            through various stations, transformed to pieces or parts of the end product that is later sold to consumers. Now,
            imagine the same factory where each station is &lt;strong>&lt;u>not&lt;/u>&lt;/strong> integrated with other stations. In fact,
            when material leaves one station, workers have little knowledge where to send the material for the next station or in
            what form the next station requires for optimal processing. Imagine the chaos and quality of products leaving the
            factory floor and the amount of time and money wasted on each unit produced.
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>
            To avoid such a scenario, factories rely heavily on an end-to-end process that integrates stations and one that is
            organized to streamline the manufacturing of raw materials to the end product. In fact, factories are always looking
            for ways to speed the production process and get the finished product to the consumer in the quickest way and with high
            quality.Raw material (business needs and requirements) must be shaped, stretched, and formed to become the application
            or system business uses to deliver products and services to generate Client revenue.
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>
            Without a structured approach, domain (or content) owners will develop processes using tools and techniques that are
            inconsistent between domains (stations). Description and documentation styles vary as evidenced in swimlane diagrams,
            use cases, or Microsoft Visio flowcharts and Microsoft Word documents. Further, without a structured approach, design
            and development of processes may follow&amp;nbsp;a path best suited to the&amp;nbsp;description and documentation rather than a
            process engineering discipline.
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>
            The Process Engineering Process is a structured approach that gives domain owners the ability to focus on development
            of comprehensive processes and process elements and associated descriptions.&amp;nbsp;The Process Engineering Process also
            gives the methods and tools&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;present material in a consistent way&amp;nbsp;so consumers of&amp;nbsp;methodology can
            find and use relevant information&amp;nbsp;consistently between projects.&amp;nbsp;
        &lt;/p>
