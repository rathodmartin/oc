  <mainDescription>Project success is directly related to having well defined requirements from the stakeholders. The key benefit of this
        process is that it provides the basis for defining and managing the project scope including product scope.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         The requirements must be well documented and managed through the project lifecycle. They need to be gathered, analyzed,
        and recorded to a level of detail so they can be measured during the project. Requirements are an essential element for the
        WBS. Requirements gathering start at the time the project charter is being developed and shared with the
        stakeholders.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         There are several types of requirements. They typically fall under the following categories:&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Business requirements - These represent higher-level needs of the organization including the business issues,
                opportunities, and project rationale.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Stakeholder requirements - This reflects the specific needs of the stakeholder(s).
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Solution requirements - This addresses function and overall characteristics of the solution or product. These are
                further broken down into functional and nonfunctional requirements:
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Functional requirements - This documents how the solutio or product will behave.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Non-functional requirements - This describes sometimes less tangible conditions and/or qualities for the solution
                or product. These ofte include; performance, level of service, reliability, security, safety, supportability, etc.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Transition requirements - This represents the temporary capabilities needed for transition from the current state
                to future state. They may include training or data conversion requirements.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Project requirements - These are the project norms the project needs to function effectively.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Quality requirements - These are the documented conditions or criteria needed to confirm successful completion of
                the project and its deliverables.
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul></mainDescription>
