  <mainDescription>The quality management plan, (a component of the project management plan) describes how the quality policies will be
        implemented as it relates to the project. It may be formal or informal, detailed, or outlined. The layout and detail shoud
        be determined by the requirements of the project.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        The quality management plan should be reviewed early during the initiative to ensure that decisions are based on the most
        accurate information. This helps to ensure a sharper focus on the projectâ€™s value proposition and reductions in costs and
        in the frequency of schedule overruns that were caused by rework or missed requirements.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        The quality management plan should include the quality assurance and continuous process improvement approaches for the
        project. It provides a baseline of quality measures and metrics for use in identifying risks associated with the
        project.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        The quality management plan should be updated to reflect any changes in process and practice driven by the risk responses.
        This may include changes related to requirements, quality assurance, or quality control, as well as updates to the
        requirements documentation.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Not having a Quality Management Plan, especially for complex or large project increase the risk of not meeting the
        expectation of the stakeholders either through missed requirements, poor functionality or poor performance.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>While quality planning is important for all projects, a formal Quality Management Plan may not be required for small or
        simple/less complex initiatives.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
