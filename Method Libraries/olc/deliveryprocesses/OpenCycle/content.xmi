    <refinedDescription>Projects are undertaken to realize business benefits through project work results. Deliverables may take the form of a
        product, the service, or a result that must be completed in order to finish the project. Project execution tasks extend to
        'perform quality control' and 'verify scope' until such time deliverables demonstrate satisfactory completeness and

    <refinedDescription>In addition to reviewing the work that is being performed, this process ensures that the deliverables are being delivered
        according to the project management plan. It looks at the progress of the overall project, taking corrective action when
        needed via change requests.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        The project manager should take corrective action based on how the project has been progressing. Work being undertaken is
        compared to the baseline and appropriate adjustments made to ensure that the two are harmonized.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        Additionally, risks are being managed properly, new risks identified, and that the overall project performance remains on
        track. This process is aligned closely with the direct and manage project execution process, and it is used throughout the
        project.&lt;br /></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>Perform Integrated Change Control is the process of reviewing all change requests, approving changes and managing changes
        to the appropriate deliverables and artifacts. These include organizational process assets, project documents, and the
        project management plan. Additionally, this entails communicating their disposition to the respective audience&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        This process allows for documented changes within the project to be considered holistically, while reducing project risk,
        which often arises from changes made without considering the overall project objectives.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        This Change Control process starts from the project's inception and continues through completion. Changes may be submitted
        by any stakeholder involved with the project. All changes should be recorded in writing and entered into the change
        management system. Often such change request may require information on estimated time impacts and estimated cost
        impacts.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        Typically, the project sponsor or project manager approves or rejects each change request. This approver shall be
        identified in the project management plan or by organizational procedures. Often, approved change requests require new or
        revised cost estimates, activity sequences, schedule dates, resource requirements, analysis of risk response alternatives,
        etc.&lt;br /></refinedDescription>

        entity. The status of all change requests, approved or not, shall be updated in the change log.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
         Approved change requests may include modifications such as defect repairs, revised work methods, and revised schedule.
        Change requests that have been approved can include modifications to the terms and conditions of the contract, pricing, and
