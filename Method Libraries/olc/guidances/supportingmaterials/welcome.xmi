            The Low Cost of High Performance
        &lt;/h3>
        High performing teams understand business processes at the structural level making business outcomes significantly more
        predictable, effective and efficient. High performing teams in comparison to low performing teams generate significant
        business savings such as: &lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Reduced order to cash cycles
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Reduced Process Costs: 10-15%
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Increased quality / reduced number of errors: 20-30%
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Reduced process throughput times: 10-30%
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Reduced training time / expenses: 10-30%
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Reduced number of (internal) support requests: 15-30%
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Reduced number of customer complaints: 20-30%
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Increased forecast accuracy: 15-30%
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
        &lt;br />
         These significant advantages are derived from high performing teamsâ€™ deep knowledge of business process, performance
        measures, risk metrics, strategy and goals. They are quicker to engage stakeholders to define process ownership, create
        well defined roles and responsibilities, thoughtfully prioritize tasks and remove non-value added activities.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;h3>
            Introducing .....
        &lt;/h3>
        &lt;p>
            The new &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>OpenCycle&lt;/span> -- an Open Source life cycle -- usable in software and
            systems development areas. The case to implement a structured process has already been made as evidenced by research
            and development on many software processes and frameworks -- more notewothy include the Capability Maturity Model, ISO
            9000, and Six Sigma. While frameworks provide grounding points to build processes, there are notable processes in use
            at most organizations. Those familiar with software development will have been exposed to the waterfall and iterative
            methodologies. In mature organizations, other methodologies such as Extreme Programming (XP) and Agile may also be
            readily used. In whatever form and shape, processes must be documented for it to be truly usable. Without a documented
            process, the development process is in chaos and the organization is replete with unrepeatable results. OpenCycle aims
            to bring community-driven experience, backed by years of trial and error in real-world situations to create a
            repeatable, truly usable software and systems development life cycle. The community, consisting of academia,
            practitioners, consultants and consumers to name a few, works towards a life cycle that can be applied in its native
            form to develop the thing that drives the organization.
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>
            Lets face it. Unless you are in business of developing life cycles, you are not likely to make money developing one.
            You are, however, likely to benefit by using a life cycle that works! What a better way than to bring together the
            minds of talented, dedicated and committed people who, through sheer interest, contribute and bring about form to a
            formless framework.
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>
            It is our sincere hope that users will ultimately become contributors and caretakers. If this seems implausible, take a
            tour of the life cycle by browsing the tasks, work products, role definitions &lt;span
            style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>and&lt;/span> guidance.&lt;br />
        &lt;/p></mainDescription>
