    <refinedDescription>In addition to reviewing the work that is being performed, this process ensures that the deliverables are being delivered
        according to the project management plan. It looks at the progress of the overall project, taking corrective action when
        needed via change requests.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        The project manager should take corrective action based on how the project has been progressing. Work being undertaken is
        compared to the baseline and appropriate adjustments made to ensure that the two are harmonized.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        Additionally, risks are being managed properly, new risks identified, and that the overall project performance remains on
        track. This process is aligned closely with the direct and manage project execution process, and it is used throughout the
        project.&lt;br /></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>Perform Integrated Change Control is the process of reviewing all change requests, approving changes and managing changes
        to the appropriate deliverables and artifacts. These include organizational process assets, project documents, and the
        project management plan. Additionally, this entails communicating their disposition to the respective audience&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        This process allows for documented changes within the project to be considered holistically, while reducing project risk,
        which often arises from changes made without considering the overall project objectives.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        This Change Control process starts from the project's inception and continues through completion. Changes may be submitted
        by any stakeholder involved with the project. All changes should be recorded in writing and entered into the change
        management system. Often such change request may require information on estimated time impacts and estimated cost
        impacts.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        Typically, the project sponsor or project manager approves or rejects each change request. This approver shall be
        identified in the project management plan or by organizational procedures. Often, approved change requests require new or
        revised cost estimates, activity sequences, schedule dates, resource requirements, analysis of risk response alternatives,
        etc.&lt;br /></refinedDescription>

        The cost baseline is developed as a summary of the approved budgets for the different schedule activities. It will include

        &lt;br />
        The cost baseline is used to compare with with actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, or preventive
        action is necessary. Once approved, these changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in
        scope, activity resources, or cost estimates. In the extreme case of significant change, a new cost baseline might be

    <refinedDescription>The Basis of Estimates is the supporting documentation providing the details used to establish the project estimates
        including; assumptions, constraints, level of detail, ranges, and confidence levels. This information should specify any
        basic assumptions dealing with the inclusion or exclusion of costs in the project budget.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         The level of detail supporting the cost estimate often vary by area. The supporting documentation should provide a clear
        and complete understanding of how the etimates were derived.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         This supporting information/documentation includes but is not limited to:&lt;br />

        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                The basis of the estimate or how it was developed

    <refinedDescription>The project funding requirements include all projected expenditures along with the anticipated projected liabilities. They
        outline the amount of total funding needed for the project. Often these requirements are overlaid on the cost baseline for
        each time period. While project expenditures typically occur relatively smoothly, the funding often occurs in chunks. It is
        often displayed against a cost baseline in a stair-step fashion.&lt;br /></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>Resource requirements identify the types and quantities of resources required for each activity. They are often aggregated
        to determine the estimated resources for each work package and work period. The documentation for each activity can include
        how the estimate was derived and assumptions made around each activity and resource. Available resources and their skill
        levels all are considered when determining project resources.&lt;br /></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>The project staff assignments is a document (or part of a document) that specifies which resources are assigned to each
        activity. It often includes a listing of the project team, memos defining assignments, and artifacts or portions of

    <refinedDescription>Approved change requests a result of the Perform Integrated Change Control process. They are scheduled and implemented by
        the project team. &lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        Change requests are processed according to the approved change control system by the project manager or other predefined
        entity. The status of all change requests, approved or not, shall be updated in the change log.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
         Approved change requests may include modifications such as defect repairs, revised work methods, and revised schedule.
        Change requests that have been approved can include modifications to the terms and conditions of the contract, pricing, and
        descriptions of the products, services, or results to be provided.&lt;br /></refinedDescription>
