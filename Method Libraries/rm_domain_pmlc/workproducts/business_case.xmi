  <mainDescription>A business case captures the reasoning for initiating a project or task. It is often presented in a well-structured written
        document, but may be in the form of a short verbal argument or presentation. The logic of the business case is that,
        whenever resources such as money or effort are consumed, they should be in support of a specific business need. An example
        could be that a software upgrade might improve system performance, but the &quot;business case&quot; is that better performance would
        improve customer satisfaction, require less task processing time, or reduce system maintenance costs. A compelling business
        case adequately captures both the quantifiable and unquantifiable characteristics of a proposed project.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Not having a busiess case can make defining the key objectives of the project more difficult to describe.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>There are some projects that are self-evident why it should be undertaken.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
