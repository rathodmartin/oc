  <mainDescription>The communications management plan is part of the project management plan. It describes how project communications will be
        structured, monitored, and controlled.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Often, the communications management plan includes templates and guidelines to be used throughout the project to ensure
        some levels of standardization along with a repository for such information.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Typically, the communications management plan includes:&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                The purpose for the providing such information
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                The frequency and duration for the distribution of required information
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Stakeholder communication needs
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                The receiptients of the targeted information
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Escalation process
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Information to be dispersed (this often addresses language, content, levels of detail, etc.)
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                The person responsible for communicating the specific information
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                The person approving the release of the information, especially if it is confidential
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                The format and mode of delivery of the information (ex meeting, email, etc.)
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Estimated effort, resources and budgeted costs for providing project communications
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Glossary of terms
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>The Communications Plan helps to ensure effective project communications accross all those affected by the initiative. Not
        having a plan on how to communicate with the core project team, stakeholders, etc. can lead to misunderstanding of such
        things as project scope, intent, timelines, expectations, etc. All this can lead to a poor project delivery or even failed
        projects.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>Often, projects of short duration and minimal impact to others don't require a formal communications plan. If a formal
        communications plan is deemed not needed, effective communication to all stakeholders is still an essential part of a
        successful project.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
