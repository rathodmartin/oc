  <mainDescription>The project staff assignments is a document (or part of a document) that specifies which resources are assigned to each
        activity. It often includes a listing of the project team, memos defining assignments, and artifacts or portions of
        documentation such as project organization charts and schedules.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Chaos can ensue if project members but are not assigned to any specific task. Assignments must be clear and
        unambiguous.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>Essentially all projects have staff assignments. Some are much less formal or even verbal. Formal project staff sssignments
        are less critical for projects small in scope and duration.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
