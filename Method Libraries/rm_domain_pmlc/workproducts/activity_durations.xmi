  <mainDescription>Activity Durations is the estimated period of time necessary to complete specific activities. This provides input in
        developig the schedule. The estimates typically come from the person or group on the project team who are most familiar
        with the nature of the work in the specific activity. The estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considering
        the quality and availability of the input. As more detailed and acurate data is available about the project, the accuracy
        of the duration estimates improve.&lt;br />
        The data and assumptions that support this activity are documented for each iterative estimate of activity duration.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Not having Activity Duration for projects severely hinders developing a realistic timeline of the project.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>Smaller projects, by their nature do not require a formal process to determine duration. As projects become larger and more
        complicated, determining activity durations will become necessary.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
