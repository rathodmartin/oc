  <mainDescription>The cost baseline is the approved version of the project budget. It excludes management reserves and is project-phased
        based which change must follow a formal change control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual
        results.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
        The cost baseline is developed as a summary of the approved budgets for the different schedule activities. It will include
        projected expenditures along with anticipated liabilities.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        The cost baseline is used to compare with with actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, or preventive
        action is necessary. Once approved, these changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in
        scope, activity resources, or cost estimates. In the extreme case of significant change, a new cost baseline might be
        deemed necessary.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Because of new or omitted work identified by the risk responses, the cost baseline may be updated to reflect those changes
        as well.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Cost baselines provide a point of reference to the financial viability of a given project. Not having a baseline hinders
        the ability to understand how well a given project is doing financially along the duration of the project.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>Generally, project short in duration or complexity do not require rigid financial controls. However, not having a cost
        baseline should be a conscience decision to do so.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
