  <mainDescription>Resource requirements identify the types and quantities of resources required for each activity. They are often aggregated
        to determine the estimated resources for each work package and work period. The documentation for each activity can include
        how the estimate was derived and assumptions made around each activity and resource. Available resources and their skill
        levels all are considered when determining project resources.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Understanding the necessary resources needed to effectively staff a project is critical to its success. The more complex,
        the more necessary is the need to have a clear understanding of project resource requirements.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>Small projects with one or two resources may not require a formal resource requirement document.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
