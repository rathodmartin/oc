  <mainDescription>The activity sequence defines the relationship between the necessary activities of the project. It helps to outline which
        activitie need to be completed before the next one(s) can be started. Other sequencing might define that two or more
        activities need to start simultaneously or x number of days after the start of a previous one. Still other activities take
        on a recurring relationship to other activities.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        This activity sequence is an essential element whend developing the project schedule.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Not having a strong understanding of the sequences of the project activities may result in an ineffective uses of project
        time and resources.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>An activity sequence may not be needed for projects that have very few activities defined.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
