  <mainDescription>The Basis of Estimates is the supporting documentation providing the details used to establish the project estimates
        including; assumptions, constraints, level of detail, ranges, and confidence levels. This information should specify any
        basic assumptions dealing with the inclusion or exclusion of costs in the project budget.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         The level of detail supporting the cost estimate often vary by area. The supporting documentation should provide a clear
        and complete understanding of how the etimates were derived.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         This supporting information/documentation includes but is not limited to:&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                The basis of the estimate or how it was developed
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                All assumptions made
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                All known constraints
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Ranges of possible estimates indicating that the item was considered to be between a range of values
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Confidence level of the estimate
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Not having this background information will allow for second guessing on the overall estimate of the project costs. This
        information provides some level of clarity for the project team members and a reminder on why certain estimates were
        made.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>Basis of estimates are not as critical for projects that are small or often repeated. These projects are well understood
        and do not need such level of documentation are how they were estimated.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
