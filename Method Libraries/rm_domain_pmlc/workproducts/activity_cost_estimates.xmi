  <mainDescription>Activity Cost estimates the projects costs of the schedule activity including costs for all resources required to complete
        them. These are then aggregated to obtain a cost estimate for the project. These estimates are quantitative assessments of
        the probable costs required to complete project. They are often documented in summary form or in detail.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Costs are estimated for all resources that are applied including; direct labor, materials, equipment, facilities, and
        information technology. &lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Activity cost estimate reviews are recommended to identify possible risks. The review may result in projections noting
        estimates are either sufficient or insufficient to complete the activity.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Cost estimates for each activity within a work package are rolled up to a cost estimate for each work package which, in
        turn, is rolled up again to provide an estimate for the project&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>The estimates are critical for project of any significant size. Not having these estimates can easily allow for cost
        overruns and unanticipated expense which would have been identified early. This information helps the project team and key
        stakeholders to decide whether the project is financially viable well before major expenses are incurred.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>Often, projects that are only short in duration or minimal in resources do not need the rigor of detailed estimations. In
        any case, not having these estimates should be a conscience decision to do so.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
