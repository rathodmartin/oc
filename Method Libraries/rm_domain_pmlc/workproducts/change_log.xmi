  <mainDescription>A Change Log is list of changes made during the project. Often, it includes dates of the change, along with information on
        impacts in terms of time, cost, and risk. This information is communicated to the appropriate stakeholders.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        Information is also captured for rejected change requests.&lt;br /></mainDescription>

  <reasonsForNotNeeding>Small, less complex projects may not need a formal change control process and associated change log. &lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
