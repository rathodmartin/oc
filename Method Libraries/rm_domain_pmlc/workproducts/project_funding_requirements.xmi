  <mainDescription>The project funding requirements include all projected expenditures along with the anticipated projected liabilities. They
        outline the amount of total funding needed for the project. Often these requirements are overlaid on the cost baseline for
        each time period. While project expenditures typically occur relatively smoothly, the funding often occurs in chunks. It is
        often displayed against a cost baseline in a stair-step fashion.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>For projects with long duration, it is important to understand where and when the necessary funding will be applied. Since
        funding is typically not linear or in sync with the project cost estimate/baseline, if not planned effetively, the project
        could be without the necessary funds to move forward.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>Projects with short durations and complexity often don't require funding along the project timeline. Most often all funding
        approval and appropriations are provided at the onset of a given initiative.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
