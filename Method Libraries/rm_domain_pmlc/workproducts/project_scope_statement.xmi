  <mainDescription>The project charter contains high-level information, while the project scope statement contains a detailed description of
        the scope elements in contrast to the project charter which contains high-level information. These elements are
        progressively elaborated throughout the project.&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: Candara;&quot; />
         &lt;br style=&quot;font-family: Candara;&quot; />
         The level of detail which the project scope statement defines the work that will be performed can help determine how well
        the project management team can control the overall project scope. The project scope statement, either directly or by
        reference to other documents, includes the following:&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: Candara;&quot; />
         &lt;br style=&quot;font-family: Candara;&quot; />
         
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Product scope description - Progressively elaborates the characteristics of the product, service or result
                described in the project charter and requirements documentation.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Acceptance criteria - A set of conditions that's required to be met before deliverables are accepted.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Deliverable - Any verifiable product, result or capability to perform a service that is required to be produced to
                complete a process, phase or project. They may be described at a summary level or in great detail.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Project exclusion - Identifies what is excluded from the project. Explicitly stating what is out of scope for the
                project.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Constraint - Limiting factors that affect the execution of a project or process.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Assumptions - A factor in the planning process considered to be true without proof or demonstration.
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Not having a scope statement may cause confusion as to what needs to be done and what might be excluded.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>A project scope statement may not be needed for smaller initiatives where the specific goal of the project is well defined
        and little room for misunderstanding what needs to be done.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
