  <mainDescription>These are the processes or process-related assets from any of the organizations involved in the project that can be used to
        help the project succeed. Some processes might look like an overhead or overkill but as responsible project managers, we
        are supposed to follow them religiously, period... The organizational process assets are typically grouped into two
        categories: 1. Processes and procedures for conducting work, and 2. A corporate knowledge base for storing and retrieving
        information. For example, the performing organization might have its own guidelines, policies, and procedures, whose effect
        on the project must be considered while developing the project charter and other project documents that will follow.
        Another example of an organization's process assets are the knowledge and learning base acquired from previous
        projects.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>If there are existing processes, the project may suffer either because it did not follow lessons learned (as embedded in
        the rationale of the documented process), or the project could be considered out of compliance.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>If organizational processes exist for a given task or project, they may not need to be followed if (typically) prior
        authorization is given not to follow them because of some extenuating circumstances.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
