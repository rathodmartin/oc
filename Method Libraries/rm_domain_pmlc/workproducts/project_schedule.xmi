  <mainDescription>The project schedule is the result of linking activities with planned dates, durations, milestones, and resources.
        Minimally, the project schedule includes targeted start and finish dates for each activity.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        The project schedule may be presented in summary form (often called the master schedule) or displayed in detail. While
        project schedulesl can be presented in tabular form, it is most often presented in a graphical form known as Gantt
        charts.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Having a project schedule communicates to all project stakeholders and team members what needs to be done and when. Even
        for projects of modest size, not having a project schedule will cause the project to fail.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>For projects of very short duration and scope (i.e. less than 2 or 3 weeks), a formal project schedule may not be
        necessary. As projects become longer in duration and more complex, a project schedule is essential to success.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
