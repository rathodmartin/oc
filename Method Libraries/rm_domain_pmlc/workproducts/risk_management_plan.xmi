  <mainDescription>The risk management plan describes how risk management activities are to be structured and performed. The risk management
        plan includes the following:&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        Roles and responsibilities - Defines the risk management team members for each type of activity in the risk management
        plan, and clarifies responsibilities.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Methodology - Defines the tools, approaches, and data sources that will be used to perform risk management on the
        project.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Risk categories - Allows a way for grouping potential causes of risk. An organization can use a custom categorization
        framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a very structured outline as a hierarchical
        representation of risks according to their risk categories.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Budgeting - Estimates of potential funds needed, based on assigned resources, for inclusion in the cost baseline and
        establishes protocols for application of contingency and management reserves.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Timing - Outlines the time when and how often the risk management processes will be enacted throughout the project life
        cycle and establishes the risk management activities for the project schedule.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Definitions of risk probability and impact - Provides the definitions of probability levels and impact levels. It is
        developed to the specifics of the individual project during the Plan Risk Management process.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Probability and impact matrix - A grid for mapping the probability of each risk, the probability of occurrence and its
        impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. They are prioritized according to their potential implications for having
        an effect on the project's objectives. It often uses a combination of probability and impact that lead to a risk being
        rated as &quot;high,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; or &quot;low&quot; importance are usually set by the organization.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <impactOfNotHaving>By not considering and formally understanding and planning for potential project risks outcome of the project has a higher
        potential of failure. Understanding the potential risks for project success in advance allows for activities that either
        avoid or mitigates the possible issues that may arise.&lt;br /></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>Often, very small initiative with short durations and low impact if not successful do not need a formal risk management
        process.&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
