  <mainDescription>The process of developing a rough calculation of the necessary financial dollars needed to complete project activities. It
        determines the amount of cost required to complete project work.&lt;br />
        The estimates are based on the information known at a given point in time. Trade-offs and risks should be considered, such
        as sharing of resources, make versus buy, and buy versus lease in order to achieve optimal project costs.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        Cost estimates should be continually reviewed and refined during the course of the project to reflect additional detail as
        it becomes available. Subsequently, the accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses through the
        project life cycle.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        Essentially all project information known should be taken into consideration in developing the cost estimates. This
        estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources Additional information that may be found in the
        scope baseline with contractual and legal implications, such as health, safety, security, performance, environmental,
        insurance, intellectual property rights, licenses, and permits.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        Cost estimates are often presented at the activity level or in summary format.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
