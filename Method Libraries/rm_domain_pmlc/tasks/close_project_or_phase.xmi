  <mainDescription>The close project or phase task is the process of finalizing all activities across all of the project management processes
        to formally complete a project or a phase. This allows for lessons learned, the formal ending of project work, and the
        release of organization resources to other initiatives.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        During this task the project manager reviews all prior information from the previous phases to ensure that all project work
        is completed and that the project has met its defined objectives. All stakeholders in the process needs to be engaged. This
        includes all planned activities necessary for administrative closure of the project or phase.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        The project manager reviews the scope baseline to ensure completion before considering the project closed. In the event of
        early termination of a project, the Close Project or Phase establishes the procedures to investigate and document the
        reasons for these actions.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
