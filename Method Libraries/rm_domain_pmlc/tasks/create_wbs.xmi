  <mainDescription>The work breakdown task builds the relationship of the work elements and the activities needed to support the project
        schedule.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
        A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a deliverable based family tree matrix which organizes, defines and displays the total
        scope of the project. Each descending level represents an increasingly detailed definition of a project element (product or
        service). It relates the project elements to each other and end results.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Implicit to this task is the need to define activities in such a way to meet project objectives. Cost estimates may be
        assigned using standard rates and market prices. These will be modified with negotiated rates and prices later in the
        process.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Activities must be sequenced accurately to support later development of realistic and achievable schedules.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Gather inputs from project teammates, stakeholders and people and groups familiar with the nature of specific activities.
        Duration estimates become progressively more elaborates as input data quality improves.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
