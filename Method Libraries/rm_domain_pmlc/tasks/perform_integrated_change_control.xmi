  <mainDescription>Perform Integrated Change Control is the process of reviewing all change requests, approving changes and managing changes
        to the appropriate deliverables and artifacts. These include organizational process assets, project documents, and the
        project management plan. Additionally, this entails communicating their disposition to the respective audience&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        This process allows for documented changes within the project to be considered holistically, while reducing project risk,
        which often arises from changes made without considering the overall project objectives.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        This Change Control process starts from the project's inception and continues through completion. Changes may be submitted
        by any stakeholder involved with the project. All changes should be recorded in writing and entered into the change
        management system. Often such change request may require information on estimated time impacts and estimated cost
        impacts.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
        Typically, the project sponsor or project manager approves or rejects each change request. This approver shall be
        identified in the project management plan or by organizational procedures. Often, approved change requests require new or
        revised cost estimates, activity sequences, schedule dates, resource requirements, analysis of risk response alternatives,
        etc.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
