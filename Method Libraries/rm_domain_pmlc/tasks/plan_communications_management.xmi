  <mainDescription>Plan Communications Management is the process of developing an approach and plan for project communications. It documents
        the most effective approach to communicate with the stakeholders.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Project Communications Management includes all the necessary activities for effective project communications including;
        planning, creation, distribution, control, monitoring and final disposition of the project information. Effective
        communication is essential especially with diverse stakeholders with different cultural and organizational backgrounds all
        having a bearing on the project outcome.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Information needs and methods of distribution vary widely from project to project. Other considerations may include:&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                The need to know, and who is authorized to access that information
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Timing of the information to the recipients
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Where the information is stored;
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                The format of the information; and
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Time zone, language barriers, and cross-cultural considerations.
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
        &lt;br />
         Like most of the Project Management tasks, the results of the Plan Communications Management process should be reviewed on
        a regular basis throughout the project and revised as necessary.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
