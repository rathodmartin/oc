  <mainDescription>The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of the project that will be worked by the project team to meet
        the project objectives and required deliverables.&lt;br />
         Decomposition is used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and project deliverables into smaller and more
        manageable parts. Work packages are defined units of work at the lowest level of the WBS for which duration, resources and
        costs can be estimated and managed. The amount of decomposition is often a function of the degree of control needed to
        effectively manage the project. The work breakdown process involves the following:&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Identifying and analyzing the deliverables and associated work
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Organizing the WBS in a heirachical structure
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Decomposing the upper WBS levels into lower-level subcomponents
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Validate the degree of decomposition is appropriate
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
        &lt;br />
        The planned work is found in the lowest level of WBS components, often called work packages. These work packages are used
        to group the activities where work is estimated and controlled.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
