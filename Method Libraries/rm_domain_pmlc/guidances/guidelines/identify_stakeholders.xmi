  <mainDescription>Essentially every project will have stakeholders. They are often impacted by or can impact the project in a positive or
        negative way. The ability of the project manager to effectively identify and manage stakeholders can be the difference
        between success and failure.&lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Often, stakeholders may have conflicting expectations which can create issues within the project. They can, and often do,
        exert influence over the project in order to achieve a set of outcomes that satisfy needs. Aligning the project with
        stakeholders' needs or objectives is critical to the successful management of stakeholder engagement and meeting the the
        project and organizational objectives. &lt;br />
         &lt;br />
         Project governance provides a framework in which the project manager and sponsors can make decisions that satisfy both
        stakeholder needs and expectations and organizational strategic objectives or address circumstances where these may not be
        in alignment.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
