            Project risk is an uncertain condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project
            objectives such as scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Risks result or be a result of a potential requirement,
            assumption, constraint, or condition that creates the possibility of negative or positive outcomes. Additionally, risk
            conditions may be a result of the project's or organization's environment that contribute to project risk, such as
            immature project management practices, lack of integrated management systems, concurrent multiple projects, or
            dependency on external participants who are outside the project's direct control.&lt;br />
             Risks come out of the unknowns surrounding the project. Known risks have been identified and analyzed, making it
            possible to plan responses for those risks. They cannot be managed proactively, but should be assigned a contingency.
            Unknown risks can't be managed proactively and may be assigned a management reserve.&lt;br />
