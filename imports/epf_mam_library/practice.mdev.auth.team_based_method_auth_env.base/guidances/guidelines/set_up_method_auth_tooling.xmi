  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    When setting up your tooling, make sure that the tool is installed and configuration, including any necessary&#xD;
    integrations to other products. For example, integrations with configuration management and version control tools. This&#xD;
    is especially important if a team of people will be working on the same method.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to the actual tooling, you need to make sure that you have access to the content that you will need to do&#xD;
    your authoring. For example, if the method you are authoring is an extension to an existing method, then you need to&#xD;
    have access to the existing content in its authored form (as opposed to its published form). In addition, if you have&#xD;
    existing content that you want to include in your method, make sure you have access to that, as well, to either be&#xD;
    linked to or incorporated directly in the method you are authoring.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is strongly recommended that you &quot;lock&quot; any content that you are using but that you dod not own so that you don't&#xD;
    unexpectedly edit something that is not yours.&#xD;
