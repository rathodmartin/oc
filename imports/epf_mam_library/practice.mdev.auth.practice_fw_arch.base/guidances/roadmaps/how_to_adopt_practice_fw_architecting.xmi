  <mainDescription>&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Getting started&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Begin by making sure the team, including the key stakeholders, understands the&amp;nbsp;and the key concepts and the&#xD;
    roadmaps.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Practice Framework Architecting practice assumes that the method authoring environment has been set up.&amp;nbsp; Make&#xD;
    sure that all team members can access the environment and understand how to use it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This practice supports architecting a new practice framework, as well as customizing an existing practice framework&#xD;
    architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To adopt the &quot;architect new practice framework&quot; aspects, start by identifying the context to be addressed by the&#xD;
        framework. It is recommended that the first time you apply this practice that you apply it to architect a practice&#xD;
        framework where the content to be included in the framework is well understood and where subject matter&#xD;
        experts&amp;nbsp;of the framework are part of the authoring team. Architect the practice framework&amp;nbsp;incrementally,&#xD;
        defining the guiding principals and the structure of the core&amp;nbsp;first, followed by the detailing of the core&#xD;
        elements. See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../../practice.mdev.auth.practice_fw_arch.base/guidances/roadmaps/arch_new_practice_fw_CE6D85ED.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_eV2FoKEKEd2bTrLTU21QBw&quot;>Roadmap: Architect a New Practice Framework&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;for details.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To adopt the &quot;customize existing practice framework architecture&quot; aspects, start by identifying the framework you&#xD;
        want to customize and how you want to customize it. It is recommended that the first time you apply this practice&#xD;
        that you apply it to customize a practice framework that is well understood and where subject matter&#xD;
        experts&amp;nbsp;of the framework (and the customization) are part of the authoring team. See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a&#xD;
        class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../../practice.mdev.auth.practice_fw_arch.base/guidances/roadmaps/customize_existing_practice_fw_arch_DE266E74.html&quot;&#xD;
         guid=&quot;_VQlaMKEeEd2bTrLTU21QBw&quot;>Roadmap: Customize an Existing Practice Framework Architecture&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;for&#xD;
        details.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As you apply the recommendations described in the practice, capture what you have learned, what worked for your team&#xD;
    and what didn't so that you can continually fine-tune how your team applies the practice.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Common pitfalls&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following are some common pitfalls when adopting this practice.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Selecting a practice framework whose content is not well understood as your first framework using this&#xD;
        practice.&amp;nbsp;If this is done, more time is spent understanding the framework itself rather than in effectively&#xD;
        applying the practice techniques.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Spending too much time architecting on paper.&amp;nbsp;If this is done, the time it takes to deliver the framework is&#xD;
        extended as a lot of time is spent structuring as opposed to just enough to get an initial framework out to get&#xD;
        feedback, refining the structure, as needed. Try to keep the documentation clear and concise.&amp;nbsp;Make sure that&#xD;
        the consumers of the architecture documentation (the development team) are comfortable with the format and content&#xD;
        of the documentation.&amp;nbsp;Is there more or different information they would like see?&amp;nbsp;Would they like to see&#xD;
        less?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
