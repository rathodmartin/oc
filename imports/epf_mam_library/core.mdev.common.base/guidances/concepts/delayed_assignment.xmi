  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Delayed assignment is also sometimes referred to as &quot;late&quot; assignment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are two common types of delayed assignment, delayed role assignment and delayed category assignment.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Delayed role assignment&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Roles are assigned to tasks as the performing role and to work products as the role that is responsible for the work&#xD;
    product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Delayed role assignment is where the assignment of a role to a task or work product is not done where the task or the&#xD;
    work product is defined. The result is that the roles can be swapped out without changing the tasks or the work&#xD;
    products. This supports the customization of the method to support a specific organization or set of governance&#xD;
    policies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Specifically, when delayed role assignment is used:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The base definition of a task should not refer to specific performing role(s)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The base definition of a work product should not refer to specific responsible role&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The base definition of a role should not refer to being responsible for specific work product(s) and/or refer to&#xD;
        specific performed task(s).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Delayed role assignment affects both the structuring of the method (relationships between elements) and the detailing&#xD;
    of method elements (hyperlinks in the text).&amp;nbsp;Specifically, when delayed role assignment is used:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        (structure) Performing roles are assigned separate from the base task definition.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        (structure) Responsible roles are assigned separate from the base role definition.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        (detail) Work products are written without referencing a specific responsible role.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        (detail) Tasks are written without referencing specific performing role(s).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        (detail) Roles are written without referencing specific tasks and/or work products.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        (detail) Instead of referring to a specific role, you can refer to the skills or competencies needed.&amp;nbsp;If a&#xD;
        role must be mentioned, use a generic role name (in lower case) that is easily understood.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Delayed standard category assignment&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Delayed standard category assignment is an approach where method elements are defined without referencing a specific&#xD;
    standard category in order to make it easier to define alternate categorization schemes (i.e., different domains,&#xD;
    disciplines, etc).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When&amp;nbsp;delayed standard category assignment&amp;nbsp;is used, assignment of elements to standard categories is not done&#xD;
    in the base method element definition.&amp;nbsp;The assignments can be defined in sub-packages in the same plug-in as the&#xD;
    element or in a completely separate plug-in.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
