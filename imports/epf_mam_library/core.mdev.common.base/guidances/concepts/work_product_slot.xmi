  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work product slots are indirections for the &lt;em>inputs&lt;/em> of tasks of a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/concepts/practice_F5C8EAAB.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_qhCTAFRREd2CWscN8Mx6rg&quot;>Practice&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;that allow practices to be documented independent of any other&#xD;
    practice, i.e. independent of the work products produced by other practices. Practice task refer to work product slots&#xD;
    as inputs, rather than refer directly to specific work products. Work product slots should never be listed as an output&#xD;
    of a task.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Practices that create specific&amp;nbsp;work products indicate what work product slots those concrete work products&#xD;
    fulfill.&amp;nbsp;Then, when both the slot fulfilling practices and the slot-consuming practices are&amp;nbsp;included in a&#xD;
    configuration, the fulfilling work products&amp;nbsp;will be&amp;nbsp;associated with&amp;nbsp;the work product slots.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, it is quite possible to write a task for creating an object-oriented analysis model for a set of&#xD;
    requirements independent of the concrete format the requirements have been captured in and the practice that was used&#xD;
    to elicit them. The requirements could be use cases, scenarios, user stories, stakeholder requests, an IEEE-830&#xD;
    compliant specification or any other form. Hence, you could model an input relationship to a work product&#xD;
    slot&amp;nbsp;such as specification and describe for the analysis task how one would look for specific properties in the&#xD;
    input specification work product slot, such as the description of a user interaction or the description of a static&#xD;
    structure, to denote which parts of the specification are relevant to consider for which parts of the analysis.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    On the other hand, when a specific practice is selected for capturing and representing a specification such as Use-Case&#xD;
    Based Development, and is combined with the object-oriented analysis practice, you actually want to see the concrete&#xD;
    work products available through the selection of that use case practice, substituting the abstract specification&#xD;
    placeholder when reviewing the analysis task. In addition, you will expect that use-case specific guidance to be&#xD;
    available for the use case based analysis as well, refining the generic instruction of the task.&amp;nbsp; Work product&#xD;
    slots support this.&#xD;
